# Project description

This is a simple restaurant ordering app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. The app allows customers to select items from a menu and place their order.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to build the structure of the app and display content.
- CSS: Used to style the app and make it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity to the app, such as the ability to place an order.
- Vite: Used as the build tool for the app, to compile the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single, functional web app.

## Concepts Used

- Functions: Used to encapsulate specific functionality and make the code more readable and organized.
- Arrays: Used to store and manage the menu items.
- Array Methods: Used to manipulate the menu items, such as the `forEach` method, which is used to loop through the items and display them on the menu page.
- `setTimeout` to simulate real-world delays, such as the time it takes for a server to respond.

## Getting Started

To run this app, simply download the code, open it in your favorite code editor, and run the app using Vite. Using the following command

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the app is running, you should see a menu page that displays the available menu items. You can add items to your order by clicking on them, and once you have everything you want, you can click the "Place Order" button to submit your order.

I hope you enjoy using this restaurant ordering app!
